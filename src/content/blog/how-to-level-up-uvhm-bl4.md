### ðŸ“Œ What is UVHM?

Instead, UVHM becomes available immediately after completing the main story, allowing you to continue progressing with your existing character while facing dramatically increased challenges.

### ðŸ“Œ Key UVHM Features

**Enhanced Difficulty:** Enemies possess significantly more health and deal increased damage, requiring optimal builds and strategies to succeed.

**Superior Rewards:** Every aspect of rewards scales upward, including cash drops, **Eridium** acquisition, combat XP, and loot quality.

**Five-Tier Progression:** UVHM consists of five distinct ranks, each offering escalating difficulty and correspondingly better rewards.

**Elemental Scaling:** Elemental affinities and armor interactions become more pronounced at higher UVHM levels.

To access UVHM, you must complete the main story campaign with your character. Once you finish the final story mission, UVHM becomes available immediately without requiring a new playthrough.
