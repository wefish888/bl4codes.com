If you're hunting for legendary loot in **Borderlands 4**, Maurice's Black Market Vending Machine is your weekly ticket to some of the best gear in the game. This special vendor offers top-tier legendary weapons for cash, but there's one catch - it moves to a new location every week. Here's everything you need to know about finding Maurice's elusive vending machine.

## 🎯 Current Week's Location

Maurice's Black Market Vending Machine is currently located in the **Grindstone of the Worthy** area in **Carcadia Burn**. More specifically, you'll find it in a small rusted building on a hill almost directly north of the Rustical Hurl silo in the northwest corner of the map.

### 📌 How to Get There

The fastest route to this week's Maurice location:

1. ****Fast Travel to Rustical Hurl Order Silo** - This is your starting point and the closest fast travel location

2. ****Head North Up the Hill** - Follow the rocky path upward from the silo

3. ****Look for the Distinctive Building** - You're searching for a structure with a giant sphere-like construction on top

4. ****Find the Balcony** - The vending machine is located on the balcony of this building, positioned on the rocky overlook

### 📌 Visual Identification Tips

The vending machine has a unique quirk - it appears slightly invisible or translucent until you get within about twenty meters of it. Don't worry if you can't see it immediately; just get close to the building and it will materialize.
