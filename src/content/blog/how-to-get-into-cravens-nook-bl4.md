## ðŸŽ¯ Understanding Craven's Nook

### ðŸ“Œ What is Craven's Nook?

Craven's Nook is an Order Bunker located in the treacherous Terminus Range region, specifically within the Heart of the Mountain area. These Order Bunkers serve as high-difficulty challenge areas containing powerful enemies, valuable loot, and unique boss encounters that test your combat skills and problem-solving abilities.

### ðŸ“Œ Strategic Importance
