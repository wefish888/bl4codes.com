# What is the Quest Called for Legendary Vending Machine **BL4**? Complete Guide to Maurice's Bounty

When players first encounter whispers of a mysterious legendary vending machine in **Borderlands 4**, they're often puzzled about how to access this coveted vendor. The quest that unlocks Maurice's legendary Black Market vending machine is called **"Ultimate **Vault Hunter**: Maurice's Bounty"** - and it's one of the most important post-campaign activities you'll want to complete.

---

## 🎯 Understanding Maurice's Black Market System

Maurice's Black Market represents a revolutionary approach to legendary weapon distribution in **Borderlands 4**. Unlike traditional vendors who remain stationary, Maurice operates a roaming vending machine that changes location weekly, creating a treasure hunt experience that keeps players engaged long after completing the main story.

The system draws inspiration from Destiny's Xur vendor, where players must actively search for the merchant's current location to access exclusive legendary gear. This mechanic transforms what could be a mundane shopping experience into an exciting weekly activity that brings the community together as players share location discoveries.

## 🎯 Prerequisites for Accessing Maurice's Bounty Quest

Before you can undertake the "Ultimate **Vault Hunter**: Maurice's Bounty" quest, you must meet several critical requirements that ensure you're properly prepared for the endgame content system.

### 📌 Complete the Main Campaign

The primary prerequisite involves finishing **Borderlands 4**'s entire main story campaign. This requirement isn't arbitrary - it ensures players have experienced the full narrative arc and understand the game's core mechanics before diving into the more complex endgame systems.

Completing the campaign typically takes 25-35 hours for most players, depending on your playstyle and whether you engage with side content during your playthrough. The final boss encounter against the Timekeeper serves as your gateway to unlocking Ultimate **Vault Hunter** Mode and its associated questlines.

### 📌 Unlock Ultimate **Vault Hunter** Mode (UVHM)

Upon defeating the final boss, you'll automatically gain access to Ultimate **Vault Hunter** Mode, which serves as **Borderlands 4**'s endgame difficulty tier. UVHM introduces several new mechanics, including increased enemy scaling, enhanced loot quality, and access to exclusive activities like Maurice's Black Market.

The mode fundamentally changes how progression works, with enemies and loot scaling more aggressively to provide sustained challenge and reward progression. This scaling system ensures that Maurice's legendary offerings remain relevant throughout your extended playtime.

## 🎯 The "Ultimate **Vault Hunter**: Maurice's Bounty" Quest Walkthrough

Once you've met the prerequisites, the quest becomes available through your UVHM questline. The quest serves multiple functions beyond simply introducing Maurice's Black Market - it teaches players how the weekly rotation system works and establishes the gameplay loop that will define much of their endgame experience.

### 📌 Quest Objectives and Completion

The quest objectives are straightforward but meaningful:

1. ****Locate Maurice's Black Market**: The quest will mark the current week's location on your map, eliminating the guesswork for your first encounter

2. ****Interact with the Vending Machine**: Examine Maurice's inventory to understand the pricing structure and legendary selection

3. ****Purchase Any Legendary Item**: Complete the transaction to demonstrate your understanding of the system

4. ****Return for Quest Completion**: Confirm your successful interaction with the Black Market system

The quest completion requires purchasing any legendary item from Maurice's machine, regardless of its utility for your current build. This requirement ensures players engage with the purchasing mechanics and understand the cash-based economy that drives Maurice's system.

### 📌 Understanding Weekly Rotations

After completing the introductory quest, Maurice's Black Market operates on a weekly rotation schedule that resets every Thursday at 12:00 PM EDT. This timing ensures global accessibility while creating predictable windows for players to plan their legendary shopping expeditions.

Each weekly rotation brings:

- **New Location**: Maurice's machine appears in a different area of Kairos

- **Fresh Inventory**: Completely new legendary weapon selection

- **Unique Player Offerings**: Each player sees different inventory options, encouraging social interaction and trading discussions

## 🎯 Maurice's Black Market Locations and Navigation

Understanding where Maurice's Black Market can appear helps players develop efficient search strategies for future weeks. The vending machine spawns in various locations across Kairos, typically in areas that are easily accessible but not immediately obvious.

### 📌 Common Spawn Areas

Maurice's machine favors locations that balance accessibility with discovery challenge. You'll commonly find the Black Market in:

- **Major Settlement Outskirts**: Near faction towns but not within the main hub areas

- **Exploration Zones**: Areas that reward thorough map exploration

- **Story-Relevant Locations**: Places with narrative significance that players have previously visited

- **Resource-Rich Areas**: Zones where players naturally spend time farming or collecting materials

### 📌 Navigation Tips

When searching for Maurice's weekly location, consider these strategies:

- **Check Community Resources**: Player communities often share weekly locations shortly after reset

## 🎯 Maximizing Your Maurice's Black Market Experience

Successfully completing "Ultimate **Vault Hunter**: Maurice's Bounty" opens the door to one of **Borderlands 4**'s most rewarding endgame activities. However, getting the most value from Maurice's offerings requires strategic planning and resource management.

### 📌 Cash Management Strategies

Maurice's inventory uses the standard cash currency, but legendary prices can be substantial. Effective cash management involves:

- **Regular Boss Farming**: Maintain steady income through repeatable boss encounters

- **Sell Unwanted Legendaries**: Convert excess legendary drops into shopping funds

- **Complete Daily Activities**: Participate in UVHM daily missions for consistent cash flow

- **Optimize Farming Routes**: Develop efficient paths that maximize cash per hour invested

### 📌 Inventory Planning

Since each player sees unique offerings, approach Maurice's machine with flexible build goals rather than seeking specific items. This randomness encourages experimentation with new weapon types and builds you might not have otherwise considered.

Consider keeping a wishlist of legendary archetypes rather than specific weapons, allowing Maurice's random offerings to surprise you with build possibilities you hadn't explored.

## 🎯 Integration with Endgame Progression

Maurice's Black Market doesn't exist in isolation - it integrates seamlessly with other UVHM progression systems to create a comprehensive endgame experience. The legendary weapons purchased from Maurice often serve as stepping stones to more specialized farming activities.

### 📌 Synergy with Boss Farming

Legendary weapons from Maurice can provide the power boost needed to tackle more challenging boss encounters, which in turn drop specific legendary items that Maurice might not offer. This creates a progression cycle where Maurice's offerings enable access to more targeted farming opportunities.

### 📌 Ultimate **Vault Hunter** Mode Integration

The cash requirements for Maurice's inventory encourage active participation in UVHM activities, ensuring players engage with the full breadth of endgame content rather than focusing exclusively on the Black Market.
